## TL;DR

Short, prioritized actions to improve your portfolio: add a clear value proposition, a narrative About page, 2–3 project case studies, and a content schedule (tutorials + postmortems). Add social proof, deployment links, SEO metadata, and monitor performance.

## Priority improvements

1. Clear hero + value proposition: one sentence who you are and what you do, with a CTA (Hire / Projects / Contact).
2. About page: narrative (background, strengths, roles), timeline, measurable impact (numbers).
3. Project case studies: problem, your role, approach, architecture, code snippets, results, lessons learned.
4. Technical blog posts: tutorials, deep dives, postmortems, how-you-built-it.
5. Live demos + source links: GitHub + instructions to run locally.
6. Resume / one-page PDF and a "work with me" CTA.
7. Social proof: testimonials, company logos, talks, notable contributions.
8. SEO: meta descriptions, Open Graph, JSON-LD, sitemap.xml.
9. Accessibility & performance: Lighthouse checks, alt text, semantic markup, fast images.
10. Analytics & error monitoring: GA/Plausible, Sentry or similar.

## Content ideas (pick a few to start)

- 2–3 detailed project case studies (use the case study template below).
- 1 tutorial series: how you built a project (split into parts).
- Tooling & infra writeup: CI/CD, deployment, testing, linting.
- Opinion pieces: tradeoffs (SSR vs static), library choices.
- Short update posts: "What I worked on this month".
- Curated resources: recommended tools and why you like them.

## Article / case study template

Use as frontmatter + structure for articles in app/articles/\*.md.

````markdown
---
title: "How I built Project X"
date: "2025-10-18"
description: "Project X: problem, approach, architecture, results."
tags: ["project", "nextjs", "case-study"]
featured: true
---

## TL;DR

One-paragraph summary: problem, your role, and outcome (numbers).

## Problem

Describe the problem and constraints.

## Role & Responsibilities

What you did (design, infra, code, PM).

## Approach & Architecture

Explain architecture, include diagrams/screenshots.

## Key Technical Decisions

- Decision 1 + why
- Decision 2 + tradeoffs

```ts
// short, focused code snippet
function example() {
  return "small runnable example";
}
```
````

## Results

Quantitative outcomes, metrics, screenshots.

## Lessons learned

Bullet list of takeaways and next steps.

Where to add pages (repo conventions)
------------------------------------
- Content files: add to app/articles/*.md (frontend reads these via app/lib/articles.ts).
- About page: put under a layout group, e.g. app/(clean-layout)/about/page.tsx.
- Projects index: app/(wide-layout)/projects/page.tsx.
- When editing markdown, use frontmatter tags array (tags: [...]) rather than legacy tag string.

Project listing (example server component)
-----------------------------------------

```tsx
// Example to place at: app/(wide-layout)/projects/page.tsx
import Link from "next/link";

const projects = [
  { id: "my-project", title: "My Project", description: "Short blurb", href: "/articles/2025-10-18-my-project-case-study" },
  // add more
];

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <main className="p-6">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">Projects</h1>
      <ul className="mt-6 space-y-4">
        {projects.map(p => (
          <li key={p.id} className="p-4 border rounded">
            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold"><Link href={p.href}>{p.title}</Link></h2>
            <p className="mt-1 text-sm">{p.description}</p>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </main>
  );
}
````

## Quick checklist to validate changes

- npm run dev -> visually check About / Projects / article pages
- npm run build -> catch build-time/type issues
- npm run lint and npm run format
- When you want to open the local site in the host browser:
  - "$BROWSER" http://localhost:3000

## Suggested next steps (pick one)

- I can scaffold an About page under app/(clean-layout)/about/page.tsx.
- Or create 1 project case-study file in app/articles/ using the template above.
- Or generate 3 starter article files from the template.

If you want a scaffold, tell me which option and provide a short bio + one project to include.
