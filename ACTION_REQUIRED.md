# 🚀 Quick Action Required

## What You Need to Do

I've created all the tools and scripts needed to add your Google Photos image to the gallery, but I cannot download the image directly because the Google Photos domain is blocked in my environment.

**You need to complete just 3 simple steps:**

---

## Step 1: Download the Image 📥

Open this link in your browser:
```
https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipN7oK9SE5P1hvGLR8vrG-xI3-YxmzrsPa8LgggSyO-jiwMVgJSkN_B6dYc8qiD_uw/photo/AF1QipNv3ZfC2bHaK5avTVxqj0t7g8AafOXCq-d3VWf6?key=cU1fd3hremRBbVdyakVpZjZxUzJaN3ZnaTZVSy13
```

Then:
1. Right-click on the image
2. Select "Open image in new tab"
3. Right-click again and "Save image as..."
4. Save it to your Downloads folder (any filename is fine)

---

## Step 2: Compress and Add to Gallery 🖼️

Open your terminal in the repository root and run:

```bash
# Replace 'downloaded-photo.jpg' with your actual filename
# Replace 'mar-2025.jpg' with an appropriate name (month-year.jpg format)

python3 scripts/compress-gallery-image.py ~/Downloads/downloaded-photo.jpg mar-2025.jpg 80
```

This will automatically:
- ✓ Compress the image to ~80KB
- ✓ Resize if needed
- ✓ Save to `public/images/gallery/mar-2025.jpg`

---

## Step 3: Update the Gallery Page 📝

Edit `app/(wide-layout)/gallery/page.tsx`

Find this section:
```typescript
const galleryData = [
  {
    year: 2025,
    images: ["/images/gallery/feb-2025.jpg"],
  },
  ...
```

Change it to:
```typescript
const galleryData = [
  {
    year: 2025,
    images: [
      "/images/gallery/feb-2025.jpg",
      "/images/gallery/mar-2025.jpg",  // ← Add this line
    ],
  },
  ...
```

**Important:** Use the same filename you specified in Step 2!

---

## Step 4: Test and Verify ✅

```bash
# Run development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000/gallery in your browser
# Verify the new image appears correctly

# Build to ensure everything works
npm run build
```

---

## Step 5: Commit Your Changes 💾

```bash
git add public/images/gallery/mar-2025.jpg
git add app/(wide-layout)/gallery/page.tsx
git commit -m "Add new gallery image for March 2025"
git push
```

---

## That's It! 🎉

Your new image will be live on the gallery page.
