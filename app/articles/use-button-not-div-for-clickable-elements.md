Using `<button>` instead of `<div>` for interactive elements improves accessibility, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support. Buttons are natively focusable, respond to Enter and Space, and require less extra code. Avoid unnecessary complexity—use the right semantic element for better usability and compliance with web accessibility standards.

## 1. Accessibility Benefits

Using the correct semantic elements ensures that your web application is accessible to all users, including those relying on assistive technologies such as screen readers. A `<button>` element, for instance, is automatically recognized by screen readers and can be navigated via keyboard shortcuts, while a `<div>` does not provide these built-in functionalities without extra effort.

## 2. Built-in Functionality

Elements like `<button>` come with default behaviors that improve user experience. These include:

- Keyboard focusability (users can tab to buttons without extra code)
- Click event handling (automatically triggers on pressing Enter or Space)
- Proper styling and theming across browsers

Using a `<div>` instead of a `<button>` requires manually implementing these features, increasing development effort and potential for errors.

### Example Code Snippet

Here’s an example comparing a `<div>` and a `<button>`:

```html
<!-- Incorrect approach using a div -->
<div onclick="handleClick()" role="button" tabindex="0">Click Me</div>

<!-- Correct approach using a button -->
<button onclick="handleClick()">Click Me</button>
```

In the incorrect approach, additional attributes like `role="button"` and `tabindex="0"` are required to make the `<div>` act like a button, whereas the `<button>` handles all of this natively.

## 3. Improved SEO and Performance

Search engines prioritize well-structured, semantic HTML. Using the correct elements helps improve site indexing and ranking. Additionally, built-in functionalities reduce the need for extra JavaScript, improving performance and maintainability.

## 4. Consistent User Experience

Browsers and operating systems optimize interactions based on semantics. For example, `<button>` elements automatically inherit platform-specific styles, behaviors, and accessibility features that users expect. This leads to a more consistent and predictable experience across devices.

## Conclusion

Using proper semantic tags is not just a best practice—it’s essential for accessibility, usability, and maintainability. By using `<button>` instead of `<div>` for interactive elements, you create a more inclusive, user-friendly, and efficient web experience.

So next time you’re tempted to use a `<div>` for an interactive element, ask yourself: Would a `<button>` or another semantic element be a better choice?
