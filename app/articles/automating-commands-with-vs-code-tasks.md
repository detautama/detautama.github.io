## **Abstract**

VS Code provides a task system that helps automate repetitive commands such as running scripts, installing dependencies, and executing tests. By using `tasks.json`, developers can define and execute common commands efficiently. This article explores the basics of configuring and running tasks in VS Code.

---

## **Introduction**

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) offers built-in support for task automation. By defining tasks in a `tasks.json` file, developers can streamline workflows and eliminate the need to manually execute frequent commands. This feature is particularly useful for managing development environments, automating test execution, and simplifying project setup.

In this article, we'll cover the fundamentals of configuring tasks in VS Code, using `tasks.json` to define and execute common development commands.

## **Main Content**

### **1. Understanding `tasks.json`**

The `tasks.json` file is located inside the `.vscode` folder of a project and contains task definitions. These tasks can be run directly from VS Code's command palette.

#### **1.1 Example Configuration**

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "npm install",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "npm install"
    },
    {
      "label": "npm run dev",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "npm run dev"
    },
    {
      "label": "run test in apps",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "cd apps && npm run cy:e2e"
    }
  ]
}
```

### **2. Explanation of Key Properties**

- **`version`** – Specifies the task configuration format (`2.0.0` is the latest version).
- **`tasks`** – An array of task objects defining specific commands.
- **`label`** – The name of the task, which appears in VS Code when selecting tasks to run.
- **`type`** – Defines the execution type (`"shell"` means the command runs in a terminal).
- **`command`** – The actual shell command to be executed.

### **3. Task Breakdown**

#### **3.1 Install Dependencies**

This task runs `npm install` to install project dependencies.

#### **3.2 Start Development Server**

Executes `npm run dev` to start the development server.

#### **3.3 Run Tests**

Navigates to the `apps` directory and runs Cypress end-to-end tests with `npm run cy:e2e`.

## **Running Tasks in VS Code**

To execute a task:

1. Open the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
2. Search for **"Tasks: Run Task"** and select it.
3. Choose the desired task and press **Enter** to execute it.

## **Conclusion**

Using `tasks.json` in VS Code simplifies workflow automation, reducing repetitive commands and improving efficiency. Whether for installing dependencies, running a development server, or executing tests, VS Code tasks streamline the development process.
