## Introduction

Creating slide decks often feels time-consuming‚Äîchoosing a template, writing bullet points, and adjusting layouts. But if the goal is simply to **deliver ideas quickly**, there‚Äôs a faster way: combine **GitHub Copilot + VS Code + Marp**.

With this setup, you can write slides directly in Markdown while letting **Copilot** handle auto-completions or even generate entire outlines through its agent. The result? Quick slides, focused on content, without the hassle of opening PowerPoint.

## What is Marp?

[Marp](https://marp.app/) is a framework that turns Markdown files into slide presentations.

A simple example:

```markdown
---
marp: true
---

# Slide Title

- First point
- Second point
```

Save the file as `.md`, render it with Marp, and you get clean, ready-to-present slides.

- While writing slides in Markdown, Copilot can **auto-complete bullet points**.
- You can prompt it: _‚ÄúCreate 3 points about why Proof of Concepts matter‚Äù_ ‚Üí it generates content instantly.
- With **Copilot Chat/agent**, you can be even more interactive: _‚ÄúGenerate a 5-slide outline on React performance.‚Äù_
