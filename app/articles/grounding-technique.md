## What is the 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique?

   Look around and find five things. Maybe it's a plant, a lamp, the sky outside, or even your own hands. Take your time noticing them.

2. **4 Things You Can Feel**  
   Focus on four things you can touch. This could be the warmth of your sweater, the smooth surface of your phone, or the texture of your chair.

3. **3 Things You Can Hear**  
   Listen closely and find three sounds. Maybe you hear birds, a ticking clock, or the hum of a fan. Let those sounds ground you in the moment.

4. **2 Things You Can Smell**  
   Take a deep breath and notice two scents around you. If you don’t notice anything, find something with a smell, like a candle or a cup of tea.
