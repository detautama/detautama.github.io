As someone who has tried the traditional Pomodoro Technique, I quickly ran into an issue that felt like a major roadblock to my productivity. After completing a 25-minute work session, I would immediately transition to a 5-minute break as prescribed. But when the break was over, I found it incredibly challenging to get back into the flow of work. My focus would feel fragmented, and it would take several minutes—sometimes even longer—just to figure out where I left off or regain the rhythm I had before the break.

This "hard restart" problem was frustrating. Instead of feeling refreshed, I often felt like I was starting from scratch after every break. It made me dread the stop-and-go nature of the Pomodoro routine, and I started questioning whether it was even helping my productivity.

After reflecting on why this was happening, I realized the issue was the abrupt switch between working and resting. Cutting directly from work mode to rest mode didn’t give my mind enough time to process or transition smoothly. I felt like I was losing my train of thought every single time. Worse, it disrupted my overall workflow, leaving me with lingering stress about how much time I was losing in these awkward transitions.

## How I Solved It: The Custom Pomodoro Approach

To tackle this problem, I decided to experiment with adding a short review and recap phase between work and rest. Here's what I did:

### 1. Pause and Reflect (5 Minutes)

Instead of diving straight into a break, I now take 5 minutes to review what I just worked on. This includes:

- Summarizing what I’ve accomplished in the last 25 minutes.

- Writing down any key thoughts or unresolved ideas that I need to revisit later.

### 2. Updating my to-do list to make sure my next steps are clear

Transition to Rest (5 Minutes):
Once I’ve captured my progress and set myself up for the next session, I feel more at ease taking a genuine break. Whether it’s stretching, grabbing a quick snack, or simply resting my eyes, I know exactly what I’ll do when I return.

## The Difference It Made

Adding this review phase was a game-changer for me. Not only did it eliminate the hard restart problem, but it also gave me a sense of closure for each work session. I didn’t feel like I was leaving tasks unfinished or losing track of what I was doing. Now, when I come back from a break, I’m able to jump right into the next task with clarity and confidence. The sense of continuity this approach provides has made my work sessions more productive and far less stressful.

This small adjustment turned a frustrating routine into a sustainable system that actually works for me. If you’ve ever struggled with regaining focus after a break, I can’t recommend this approach enough. It’s a simple yet effective way to maintain momentum and avoid that “starting over” feeling that can derail your productivity.
