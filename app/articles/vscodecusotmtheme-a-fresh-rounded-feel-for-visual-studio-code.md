If youâ€™ve been feeling like your **Visual Studio Code** looks a little... stale, then **vscodeCusotmTheme** by [mahmoud-asdf](https://github.com/mahmoud-asdf/vscodeCusotmTheme) is exactly what you need.

This repo isnâ€™t just another random theme â€” itâ€™s a full **customization package** using **custom CSS and JavaScript**.  
When I tried it, it honestly made VS Code feel **fresh and modern**, especially with the **rounded UI** touches that make everything look smoother and more polished â€” like using a brand-new editor.

## âœ¨ Highlights

- **Rounded UI Design**: Buttons, inputs, and other elements now have that soft, rounded look, giving a much cleaner and friendlier interface.
- **Deep Customization**: Tweak tiny details of the UI with the included `css.css` and `js.js`.
- **Instant Setup**: Just copy the provided `settings.json`, install a custom CSS loader extension, and enjoy.
- **Super Lightweight**: No bloat. Only pure UI improvements.

## ðŸ›  Quick Start

1. Install a custom CSS/JS extension for VS Code, such as:
   - Custom UI Style
   - Custom CSS Hot Reload
   - Custom CSS and JS Loader
2. Copy the repoâ€™s `settings.json` into your settings.
3. Update paths to match your local files if needed.
4. Enable the extension â€” and boom, your editor feels brand new.
