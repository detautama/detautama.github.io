## What is a POC, and Why Does It Work?

A POC is a minimal implementation designed to test a specific idea or functionality. Unlike a full-fledged feature, a POC is quick and lightweight, just enough to validate feasibility. It helps isolate the core problem, avoiding unnecessary dependencies. It allows for rapid experimentation and iteration without breaking existing systems. Early validation prevents wasted time on unworkable solutions. Seeing a concept work, even in a basic form, builds momentum. A working prototype makes it easier to convey ideas to stakeholders.

## When Should You Use a POC?

Through my experience, I’ve found POCs particularly helpful in a few situations. If I’m exploring an unfamiliar technology or framework, a POC helps me understand how it works before committing fully. When dealing with an ambiguous feature, building a small prototype clarifies what’s actually needed. If there are multiple possible solutions, quickly testing a few options allows me to choose the best one. It’s also essential when evaluating performance concerns or testing whether a third-party service meets my requirements.

## How to Approach a POC Without Overthinking It

Creating a POC doesn’t have to be time-consuming. Start by defining the key question—what exactly do you need to validate? Focus on the simplest way to test your idea. Write quick, disposable code that prioritizes proving feasibility over clean architecture. Run experiments, make changes, and document findings. If the POC is successful, refine it into a real implementation. If not, pivot as needed.

## Example: Payment Gateway Integration

One time, I had to integrate a payment gateway into an application, but I wasn’t sure if it supported a key feature we needed. Instead of diving into full development, I built a quick POC. I set up a minimal backend, called the API with test credentials, and verified if it returned the expected responses. Within a few hours, I had clarity. If it worked, I could proceed confidently. If not, I would have saved myself days of effort by identifying roadblocks early.

## Conclusion: Embrace the Small Wins

When faced with a tough challenge, resist the temptation to go all in from the start. Instead, start small with a POC. It helps validate assumptions, uncover potential roadblocks early, and leads to more efficient solutions. Some of my best projects began with tiny, imperfect experiments that later evolved into something much bigger. In software development—and in life—sometimes the best progress comes from taking that small first step.
