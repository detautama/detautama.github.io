In today's increasingly digital financial world, more people rely on online loan applications and banking services to meet their financial needs. However, without proper planning, loans can become a financial burden that is difficult to manage. That is why I built **Pintar Kredit**, a web-based application that helps users analyze loan applications before submitting them to financial institutions.

## Technologies Used

This application is developed using **React** with **Vite** as a build tool to ensure optimal performance. Additionally, I utilize **OpenAI** to provide advice based on user data, helping them understand loan eligibility and potential risks before making a decision.

## Key Features

1. **Loan Simulation** - Users can input their loan details and receive automatic calculations regarding monthly installments, interest, and total payments.
2. **Loan Eligibility Analysis** - Based on the financial information provided, the system evaluates the likelihood of loan approval.
3. **Smart Advice** - With the help of OpenAI, the application offers recommendations on the best loan options based on user profiles.
4. **Guaranteed Privacy** - All calculations are performed directly in the application without storing user data.

## Why Pintar Kredit?

I built this application because I noticed the increasing availability of online loans, which can be a double-edged sword for consumers. With tools like Pintar Kredit, users can make more informed financial decisions before committing to a loan.
