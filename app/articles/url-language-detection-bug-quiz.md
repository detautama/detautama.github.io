When building multilingual websites, a common approach to detect the user‚Äôs language is by inspecting the URL. For example, you might check if the URL contains `"en"` to decide if the page is in English or some other language.

Here‚Äôs a simple JavaScript snippet that tries to do exactly that:

```js
if (window.location.href.includes("en")) {
  // Set language to English
} else {
  // Set language to Swedish
}
```

### The Scenario

Imagine your website has URLs structured like this:

- `https://example.com/en/about` (English page)
- `https://example.com/sv/about` (Swedish page)
- `https://example.com/customer-cases/vattenfall` (case study without language prefix)

At first glance, the condition looks fine ‚Äî if the URL contains `"en"`, treat it as English. Otherwise, use Swedish.

### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Can you spot the bug?

The bug lies in the way the URL is checked with `.includes("en")`. This check looks for the substring `"en"` anywhere in the entire URL, not specifically in the language segment. This can lead to false positives.

#### What can go wrong?

- **False positives:** The word `"en"` can appear elsewhere in the URL, such as in the path or query parameters, unrelated to the language. For example:

  - `https://example.com/customer-cases/vattenfall`  
    The string `"en"` appears in `"vattenfall"`, so `.includes("en")` returns `true`, wrongly setting the language to English.

- **Incorrect language detection:** The site might mistakenly show content or UI elements in English on pages that are actually Swedish or neutral.

### How to fix it?

Instead of searching for `"en"` anywhere in the URL, restrict the check to the part of the URL that actually specifies the language ‚Äî usually the first path segment.

Here‚Äôs an improved approach:

```js
const pathSegments = window.location.pathname.split("/");
const lang = pathSegments[1]; // first path segment after the domain

if (lang === "en") {
  // Set language to English
} else if (lang === "sv") {
  // Set language to Swedish
} else {
  // Default language or fallback
}
```

### Why is this better?

- **Precise detection:** It explicitly looks at the first path segment, where the language code should be.
- **Avoids false positives:** It won‚Äôt mistake parts of other words or parameters for language codes.
- **Easily extensible:** You can add more languages just by checking for different codes.

### Summary

Checking for substrings like `"en"` anywhere in the URL is a common but fragile approach to language detection. Always narrow down your checks to the specific URL segment responsible for the language to avoid bugs.
